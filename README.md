# API Issues

This is only for issues with the API. Don't post an issue about Website issues or the site being down. 

We have a repo for [Website issues](https://github.com/What-The-FAQ/Website/issues) and a status page for checking what is going on with the site.



We may remove your issues at any moment if you post anything that shouldn't be placed here and we reserve the right to do so without warning at our discretion.
